I created a portfolio using HTML and CSS to demonstrate my skills in web development and design. The portfolio includes a well-structured layout, responsive styling, and clean visuals, showcasing my attention to detail and creativity. It serves as a professional platform to highlight my experience and capabilities effectively.
